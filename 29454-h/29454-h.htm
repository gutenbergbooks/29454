<h1>PUNCH,<br />
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>
<h2>VOLUME 147.</h2>
<hr class="full" />
<h2 class="smcap">November 25, 1914.</h2>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p><span class='smcap'>Enver Pasha</span>, in a proclamation to
the Turkish troops, says: "The army
will destroy all our enemies with the
aid of Allah and the assistance of the
Prophet." It is rumoured that the
<span class='smcap'>Kaiser</span> is a little bit piqued about it.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>We learn from a German paper that,
since the brave Ottomans have discovered
that their Culture and that of
the Germans are one, many Englishmen
who live in Crescents are crying
out in fury for an alteration of their
addresses.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>According to a Berlin journal, about
2,000 players of orchestral instruments
have been thrown out of
employment by the war.
It is suggested that, with
a view to providing them
with more employment,
reverses as well as victories
should be musically
celebrated in the
capital.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>We are glad to see that
the names of battles in
Belgium show a tendency
to become more cheery.
The other day, for instance,
we had the battle
of the Yperlee&mdash;and we
may yet have a battle of
Yip-i-yaddy-i-yay.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>It is rumoured that a
compromise has been arrived
at in regard to the
proposal, emanating from
America, that the war
shall be stopped for twenty-four hours
on Christmas Day. The combatants,
it is said, have agreed to fire plum-puddings
instead of cannon-balls.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Among the promotions which we do
not remember seeing gazetted is that of
<span class='smcap'>Karl Gustav Ernst</span>, a German barber-spy.
At the Old Bailey, the other day,
Mr. Justice <span class='smcap'>Coleridge</span> promoted him
to be a Steinhauer or stone-hacker.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<blockquote>
<p class='center'>"'MIRACLE' PRODUCER KILLED."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>This is unfortunate for the Germans, for
if ever they needed a miracle it is now.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>"Information that has come into our
possession," says <i>The Grocer</i>, "proves
<i>to our satisfaction</i> that Germany has
been receiving plentiful supplies of tea
from our shores through neutral countries
since the outbreak of hostilities."
The italics are ours: the satisfaction
appears to be our contemporary's.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A cynic sends us a tip for the recruiting
department of our army. "Why
go for the single man?" he asks. "We
may expect just as much courage from
the married man. He has already proved
his pluck."</p>
<hr class='short' />
<blockquote>

<p>The Germans, who have already been
calling the Allied forces "The Menagerie,"
should appreciate this item.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Angry newspaper men are now
calling a certain institution the Suppress
Bureau.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A solicitor having announced that
he is prepared to make the wills of
the men of a certain regiment free of
charge, another enterprising legal gentleman,
not to be outdone, would like
it to be known that he is willing to act
as residuary legatee without a fee.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>In his interesting sketch, in <i>The
Times</i>, of the <span class='smcap'>Prince of Wales'</span> career
at the <a name='TC_1'></a><ins title="Added comma">University,</ins> the <span class='smcap'>President</span> of
Magdalen mentions that His Royal
Highness "shot at various country
houses round Oxford." We hope that
this will not be quoted against the
<span class='smcap'>Prince</span> by a spiteful German Press,
should any bullet marks be found one
day on the walls of some castle on the
Rhine.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>It came as quite an unpleasant
surprise to many persons to learn
from Mr. <span class='smcap'>Asquith</span> that the War is
costing us a million pounds a day,
that being more than some of us spend
in a year.</p>

<h2>THE PRICE OF PATRIOTISM.</h2>
<p>Helen and I are economising; so
the other evening we dined at the
Rococo.</p>
<p>"That's no economy," you cry; so
let me explain.</p>
<p>In common with most other folk
who are not engaged in the manufacture
of khaki, or rifles, or Army
woollens, or heavy siege-guns (to which
I had not the foresight to turn my
attention before the war came along),
we have found it necessary to adopt
a policy of retrenchment and reform;
and one of our first moves in this
direction was to convert Evangeline
from a daily into a half-daily. Evangeline
is not a newspaper but a domestic
servant, and before the new order was
issued she had been in the habit of
arriving at our miniature flat at 7.30 in
the morning (when it wasn't 8.15),
and retiring at 9 in the evening.</p>
<p>Now, however, Evangeline goes after
lunch, and Helen, who has bought a
shilling cookery book, prepares the
dinner herself.</p>
<p>On the day in question Helen suddenly
decided to spend the afternoon
repairing a week's omissions on the
part of Evangeline. It proved a veritable
labour of Hercules, the flat
being, as Helen with near enough
accuracy gave me to understand, an
"Aeg&aelig;an stable." Tea-time came, but
brought no tea. Shortly before seven
Helen struck, and declared (this time
without any classical metaphor) that
she wasn't going to cook any dinner
that evening. Not to be outdone, I
affirmed in reply that even if she did
cook it I wasn't going to clear it away.
So we cleaned and adorned ourselves
and groped our way to the Rococo.</p>
<p>We were both too tired to go to the
trouble of choosing our dinner, and it
was therefore that we elected to make
our way through the <i>table-d'h&ocirc;te</i>, to
which we felt that our appetite, unimpaired
by tea, could do full justice.
Luxuriously we toyed with <i>hors-d'&oelig;uvre</i>,
while the orchestra patriotically intimated
that ours is a Land of Hope and
Glory; blissfully we consumed our soup,
undeterred by repeated reminders of
the distance to Tipperary. It was
with the fish that the trouble started.</p>
<p>At the second mouthful it began to
dawn upon me that what the band
was playing was the <i>Braban&ccedil;onne</i>. I
looked around, and gathered that I
was not alone in the realisation of that
fact; for one by one my fellow-diners
struggled hesitatingly to their feet, and
stood in awkward reverence while the
National Anthem of our brave Belgian
Allies was in course of execution. I
looked at Helen, and Helen looked at
me, and we both tried not to look too
regretfully at our plates as we also
adopted the prevailing pose. Not one
note of that light-hearted anthem did
the orchestra miss, and when it was
over the warmth in our hearts almost
compensated for the coldness of our
fish. We decided to jump at once to
the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>.</p>
<p>Whatever else may be said of the
<i>Marseillaise</i>, there can be no mistaking
its identity. The first bar sufficed to
bring the whole room to attention, and
a promising dish of sweetbreads shared
the fate of its predecessor. Before the
final crash had ceased to reverberate
we sat down with a thump, resigning
ourselves to the prospect of doing
double justice to the joint. But the
orchestra was not so lightly to be
cheated of its prey. True, we held out
as long as possible while the Russian
Hymn began to unfold its majestic
length, and Helen actually managed to
convey a considerable piece of saddle
of mutton to her mouth while she was
in the very act of rising. That joint,
however, was soon but a memory of
anticipation, and our hunger was still
keen upon us when the funereal strains
of the Japanese Anthem coincided with
the arrival of a wild duck. I had
always harboured secret doubts of the
advisability of Japan's joining in the
War, and now they were intensified
many times. Cold wild duck is an
impossibility even to a hungry man.</p>
<p>Ice-pudding, though scarcely satisfying,
seemed to warrant the expectation
that it would at least survive
whatever further ordeal the band had
in store for us. But that hope too
was doomed to extinction. When
<i>God Save the King</i> smote the air
the growing lethargy of the company
of diners vanished, and all joined with
a will in the recital of all its verses.
In the glow of loyal enthusiasm that
filled the room the ice gradually melted,
and as we surveyed the fluid mess upon
our plates we knew that our dinner
was gone beyond recall.</p>
<p>Weary and unappeased we crept
home through the City of Dreadful
Night. I found a remnant of cold
beef and some pickles in the kitchen,
and on this we went to bed. I slept
but little, and on five occasions watched
Helen, who has dreams, get out of bed
and stand to attention.</p>
<p>Of course it might have been worse;
for the musicians of the Rococo
evidently had not learnt the national
airs of Serbia and Montenegro; and
Portugal had not then been drawn
into the War. But until the trouble is
over I shall avoid restaurants which
harbour an orchestra. As you say, it
is no economy.</p>

<h2>TO MR. BERNARD JAW.</h2>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Illustrious Jester, who in happier days</p>
<p>Amused us with your Prefaces and Plays,</p>
<p>Acquiring a precarious renown</p>
<p>By turning laws and morals upside down,</p>
<p>Sticking perpetual pins in Mrs. Grundy,</p>
<p>Railing at marriage or the British Sunday,</p>
<p>And lavishing your acid ridicule</p>
<p>On the foundations of imperial rule;&mdash;</p>
<p>'Twas well enough in normal times to sit</p>
<p>And watch the workings of your wayward wit,</p>
<p>But in these bitter days of storm and stress,</p>
<p>When souls are shown in all their nakedness,</p>
<p>Your devastating egotism stands out</p>
<p>Denuded of the last remaining clout.</p>
<p>You own our cause is just, yet can't refrain</p>
<p>From libelling those who made its justice plain;</p>
<p>You chide the Prussian Junkers, yet proclaim</p>
<p>Our statesmen beat them at their own vile game.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Thus, bent on getting back at any cost</p>
<p>Into the limelight you have lately lost,</p>
<p>And, high above war's trumpets loudly blown</p>
<p>On land and sea, eager to sound your own,</p>
<p>We find you faithful to your ancient plan</p>
<p>Of disagreeing with the average man,</p>
<p>And all because you think yourself undone</p>
<p>Unless in a minority of one.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Vain to the core, thus in the nation's need</p>
<p>You carp and cavil while your brothers bleed,</p>
<p>And while on England vitriol you bestow</p>
<p>You offer balsam to her deadliest foe.</p>

<h3>A RIVAL OF "TIPPERARY."</h3>
<p>While much has been written of the songs that inspire
our own brave troops on the march, little is heard of those
affected by our Allies.</p>
<p>Happily <i>Mr. Punch's</i> Special Eye-witness with General
Headquarters in the Eastern Area has been enabled to send
us the words of a song which, set to an old Slav air, is
rendered with immense <i>&eacute;lan</i> by the gallant Russians as
they go into battle. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>It's a hard nut is Cracow,</p>
<p class='i2'>It's a hard nut to crack,</p>

<p>Good-bye, Przemysl;</p>
<p class='i2'>Farewell, Lemberg (Lwow);</p>
<p>It's a hard, hard nut to crack is Cracow,</p>
<p class='i2'>But we'll soon crack it now.</p>
</div></div>
<p>By the more cultured Russian regiments, <i>i.e.</i>, those
recruited in the neighbourhood of the German frontier, the
last line is rendered:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<h3><span class='smcap'>King Henry IV., Part I.</span></h3>
<p>I commend Sir <span class='smcap'>Herbert Tree's</span>
obvious desire to do his duty as an
actor-manager and a patriot. His true
intent is all for our good; and he supports
his choice of a play in which
<i>Falstaff</i> is the central obsession by a
printed quotation from the words of
"That Wise Ruler Queen Elizabeth of
England," where she says: "'Tis simple
mirth keepeth high courage alive."
But yet he does not convince me that
he has chosen wisely here. For in the
first place we are not closely interested
in civil war, as we came near to
being in the dim Ulster period; and
patriotism, which it is his object to
encourage, is like to remain unaffected
by a play in which our sympathies
are fairly distributed between rebel and
royalist. In the second place I cannot
believe that the glorification of drunkenness
and braggadocio in the person of
<i>Falstaff</i> can directly assist the cause

<p><i>The King</i> (Mr. <span class='smcap'>Basil Gill</span>) reclaims young <i>Harry</i> (Mr. <span class='smcap'>Owen Nares</span>) from old <i>Harry</i> (the Devil).</p>
</div>
<p>Having made this protest I have little
but praise for the performance itself,
though I think Sir <span class='smcap'>Herbert Tree's</span>
own lethargy was not wholly to be
excused by the hampering rotundity of
his girth; and that all this deliberate
sword-play, where you wait till your
enemy has got his right guard before
you arrange a concussion between your
weapon and his, fails to impose itself
as an image of War. But it was no
fault of the actors if we suffered a
further loss of actuality by the incredible
amount of fine poetry and rhetoric
thrown off by military men at junctures
calling for immediate action.</p>
<p>I also venture to make my complaint
to the author that the <i>Falstaff</i> scenes
are given too great a dominance, diverting
us from the main issue so long that
at one time we almost lost count of it;
and that the picture of that fat impostor
lying supine in a simulation of death
within a few feet of the fallen body of
the heroic <i>Hotspur</i> was repellent to
one's sense of the proprieties.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Matheson Lang</span> was a brave
figure as <i>Hotspur</i>; but, after lately
seeing that other keen actor, Mr. <span class='smcap'>Owen
Nares</span>, in the part of a modern intellectual
discussing the ethics of War, I
could not quite get myself to believe
in him as <i>Prince Hal</i>. He spoke
some of his lines with a fine ardour,
but he was too high-browed and slight
of body, and it was unthinkable that he
could ever have persuaded <i>Hotspur</i> to die
at his hands.</p>
<p>Sir <span class='smcap'>Herbert Tree</span> affected an almost
proprietary interest in the bibulous
humours of <i>Falstaff</i>, presenting them
with an easy and leisurely restraint;
and Mr. <span class='smcap'>Basil Gill</span> both in form
and manner made a quite good <i>King</i>.
The minor parts upheld the standard
of His Majesty's; and a pleasant
rattling of steel and shimmer of mail
ran through the scenes of active service.
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Percy Macquoid</span> had seen
to it that the period was there, and
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Joseph Harker</span> had taken good
care that the jewelry of <span class='smcap'>Shakspeare's</span>
verse should have the right setting,
though I could easily have mistaken
his Gadshill scene for a section of
the Lake Country.</p>

<h3>A GRIEVANCE.</h3>
<p>Nothing is too good for our fighting
men. Let my subscription to that
axiom be complete; and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Well, it is like this. A man who is
only a year or so too old for active service,
but feels as fit and keen as a boy,
has so many opportunities for regretting
his enforced civilism and absence
from the arena that it is hard when
additional ones are thrust upon him.</p>
<p>He may do his best at home. He
may guard gasworks, or organise funds,
or campaign as an enlister, or visit the
hospitals; but all the time he is conscious
that being here is so different
from being there. It galls him day
and night, and the only thing that can
help him at all is the society of lovely
women, and now he has lost that!</p>
<p>I hate to grumble, and I have, I believe,
shouldered my share of the new
taxes like a man, but I am not made of
such stern stuff as to be superior to all
human aid, and in my own case the
mortification of non-combating, which
now and then becomes depressingly
acute, is to be alleviated only in this
way. Nice women must do their part.</p>
<p>But do they? No. They did at first,
but no longer.</p>
<p>Let me tell you. The other evening
I found myself one of the complacent
hosts of a party of merry chattering
young women, who seemed to be quite
satisfied with our attention. All of us
were just beginning to be very jolly,
and I had actually forgotten my hard
destiny of inactivity, when who should
come into the room but an officer on
crutches, who happened to be an acquaintance
of each of our guests but was
unknown both to me and my other just
too elderly male friends. In an instant
we were alone, and alone we remained
for certainly half an hour, while every
attention was being paid by our guests
to that other. When at last they tore
themselves away and returned, their
conversation was wholly confined to
their wounded friend's adventures, and
we need not have been there at all,
except to pay the bill.</p>
<p>Now it is no fun to me to deceive
anyone but myself, and hence I shall
not go about with my arm in a sling
and win sympathy and attention to
which I am not entitled; but I do
appeal to all the young women to have
a little pity on some of us compulsory
stay-at-homes. Nothing is too good
for our fighting men. I repeat it. But
just a tiny spark of animation might
be retained in the feminine eye when
it alights upon an old friend who is
debarred from taking arms. Just a
spark, otherwise we shall go into a
melancholy decline.</p>

<h2>THE PATRIOT.</h2>
<p>This is a true story. Unless you
promise to believe me, it is not much
good my going on.... You promise?
Very well.</p>
<p>Years ago I bought a pianola. I
went into the shop to buy a gramophone
record, and I came out with
a pianola&mdash;so golden-tongued was
the manager. You would think that
one could then retire into private life
for a little, but it is only the beginning.
There is the music-stool to be purchased,
the library subscription, the
tuner's fee (four visits a year, if you
please), the cabinet for the rolls, the
man to oil the pedals, the&mdash;&mdash;however,
one gets out of the shop at last.
Nor do I regret my venture. It is
common talk that my pianola was the
chief thing about me which attracted
Celia. "I <i>must</i> marry a man with a
pianola," she said ... and there was
I ... and here, in fact, we are. My
blessings, then, on the golden tongue
of the manager.</p>
<p>Now there is something very
charming in a proper modesty about
one's attainments, but it is necessary
that the attainments should be generally
recognized first. It was admirable
in <span class='smcap'>Stephenson</span> to have said (as
I am sure he did), when they congratulated
him on his first steam-engine,
"Tut-tut, it's nothing;" but
he could only say this so long as the
others were in a position to offer the
congratulations. In order to place you
in that position I must let you know
how extraordinarily well I played the
pianola. I brought to my interpretation
of different Ops an <i>&eacute;lan</i>, a <i>verve</i>, a <i>je ne
sais quoi</i>&mdash;and several other French
words&mdash;which were the astonishment of
all who listened to me. But chiefly I
was famous for my playing of one piece:
"The Charge of the Uhlans," by <span class='smcap'>Karl
Bohm</span>. Others may have seen Venice
by moonlight, or heard the Vicar's
daughter recite <i>Little Jim</i>, but the
favoured few who have been present
when <span class='smcap'>Bohm</span> and I were collaborating
are the ones who have really lived.
Indeed, even the coldest professional
critic would have spoken of it as "a
noteworthy rendition."</p>
<p>"The Charge of the Uhlans." If you
came to see me, you had to hear it. As
arranged for the pianola, it was marked
to be played throughout at a lightning
pace and with the loudest pedal on.
So one would play it if one wished to
annoy the man in the flat below; but a
true musician has, I take it, a higher
aim. I disregarded the "FF.'s" and the
other sign-posts on the way, and gave
it my own interpretation. As played
by me, "The Charge of the Uhlans"
became a whole battle scene. Indeed,
it was necessary, before I began, that
I should turn to my audience and
describe the scene to them&mdash;in the
manner, but not in the words, of a
Queen's Hall programme:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Er&mdash;first of all you hear the cavalry
galloping past, and then there's a short
hymn before action while they form up,
and then comes the charge, and then
there's a slow bit while they&mdash;er&mdash;pick
up the wounded, and then they
trot slowly back again. And if you
listen carefully to the last bit you'll
actually hear the horses limping."</p>
<p>Something like that I would say;
and it might happen that an insufferable
guest (who never got asked again)
would object that the hymn part was
unusual in real warfare.</p>
<p>"They sang it in this piece anyhow,"
I would say stiffly, and turn my back
on him and begin.</p>
<p>But the war put a stop to music as
to many other things. For three
months the pianola has not been
played by either of us. There are two
reasons for this: first, that we simply
haven't the time now; and secondly,
that we are getting all the music we
want from the flat below. The flat
below is learning "Tipperary" on one
finger. He gets as far as the farewell
to Leicester Square, and then he breaks
down; the parting is too much for him.</p>
<p>I was not, then, surprised at the
beginning of this month to find Celia
looking darkly at the pianola.</p>
<p>"It's very ugly," she began.</p>
<p>"We can't help our looks," I said in
my grandmother's voice.</p>
<p>"A bookcase would be much prettier
there."</p>
<p>"But not so tuneful."</p>
<p>"A pianola isn't tuneful if you never
play it."</p>
<p>"True," I said.</p>
<p>Celia then became very alluring, and
suggested that I might find somebody
who would like to be lent a delightful
pianola for a year or so by somebody
whose delightful wife had her eye on a
delightful bookcase.</p>
<p>"I might," I said.</p>
<p>"Somebody," said Celia, "who isn't
supplied with music from below."</p>
<p>I found John. He was quite pleased
about it, and promised to return the
pianola when the war was over.</p>
<p>So on Wednesday it went. I was
not sorry, because in its silence it was
far from beautiful, and we wanted
another bookcase badly. But on Tuesday
evening&mdash;its last hours with us&mdash;I
had to confess to a certain melancholy.
It is sad to part with an old and well-tried
friend, particularly when that
friend is almost entirely responsible
for your marriage. I looked at the
pianola and then I said to Celia, "I
must play it once again."</p>
<p>"Please," said Celia.</p>
<p>"The old masterpiece, I suppose?"
I said, as I got it out.</p>
<p>"Do you think you ought to&mdash;now?
I don't think I want to hear a charge
of the Uhlans&mdash;beasts; I want a charge
of our own men."</p>
<p>"Art," I said grandly, "knows no
frontiers." I suppose this has been
said by several people several times
already, but for the moment both Celia
and I thought it was rather clever.</p>
<p>So I placed the roll in the pianola,
sat down and began to play....</p>
<p>Ah, the dear old tune....</p>
<p>Dash it all!</p>
<p>"What's happened?" said Celia,
breaking a silence which had become
alarming.</p>
<p>"I must have put it in wrong," I
said.</p>
<p>I wound the roll off, put it in again,
and tried a second time, pedalling
vigorously.</p>
<p>Dead silence....</p>
<p>Hush! A note ... another silence
... and then another note....</p>
<p>I pedalled through to the end. About
five notes sounded.</p>
<p>"Celia," I said, "this is wonderful."</p>
<p>It really was wonderful. For the
first time in its life my pianola refused
to play "The Charge of the Uhlans."
It had played it a hundred times while
we were at peace with Germany, but
when we were at war&mdash;no!</p>
<p>We had to have a farewell piece.
I put in a waltz, and it played it perfectly.
Then we said good-bye to our
pianola, feeling a reverence for it which
we had never felt before.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>You don't believe this? Yet you
promised you would ... and I still
assure you that it is true. But I
admit that the truth is sometimes hard
to believe, and the first six persons to
whom I told the story assured me
frankly that I was a liar. If one is to
be called a liar, one may as well make
an effort to deserve the name. I made
an effort, therefore, with the seventh
person.</p>
<p>"I put in 'The Charge of the
Uhlans,'" I said, "and it played 'God
Save the King.'"</p>
<p>Unfortunately he was a very patriotic
man indeed, and he believed it. So
that is how the story is now going
about. But you who read this know
the real truth of the matter.</p>

<p class="smcap">Wedgwood Benn s'en va-t-en guerre.</p>
</div>
<p>Here was a chance for a great speech.
Never before had English Minister submitted
such stupendous propositions.
Some of us remember how, thirty-six
years ago, <span class='smcap'>Dizzy</span>, by way of threat to
Russia, then at war with Turkey, created
profound sensation in town and
country by asking for Vote of Credit
for six millions. At close of Boer War
<span class='smcap'>Hicks-Beach</span>, then Chancellor of
Exchequer, launched a War Loan of
30 millions. 'Twas thought at the
time that we were going it, taking
a long stride towards national Bankruptcy
Court. Now it is 225 millions
in supplement of a hundred millions
voted in August. Moreover, the two
together do not carry us further than end
of financial year, 31st of March. Then
we shall begin again with another trifle of
same dimensions or probably increased.</p>
<p>How Mr. G., had he still been with
us, would have revelled in opportunity
for delivering an oration planned to
scale! How his eloquence would have
glowed over these fantastic figures!
<span class='smcap'>Herbert Henry Asquith</span> (had he been
consulted at the font, he would certainly
have objected to useless waste of time
involved in a second baptismal name)
spoke for less than quarter of an
hour, submitting proposals in baldest,
most business-like fashion. He wanted
the men and he wanted the money too.
Fewer words spoken the sooner he
would get them. So, avoiding tropes
and flights of eloquence, he just stood
at Table, a sort of humanized ledger,
briefly set forth items of his account,
totalled them up and sat down.</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Walter Long</span>, following, voiced general
dislike for prohibition that keeps
War Correspondents out of fighting
line in Flanders. Deprecated risk of
circulating information useful to the
enemy, but insisted, amid cheers from
both sides, that there might be published
letters from the front free from
such danger "that would bring comfort
and solace to the people and would do
more to attract recruits than bands and
flag-parading throughout the country."</p>
<p>Speaking later in reply, Mr. Spenlow
<span class='smcap'>Asquith</span>, while sympathising with
<span class='smcap'>Walter Long's</span> desire, explained that
state of things complained of is entirely
due to Monsieur Jorkins Poincar&eacute;.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page442' name='page442'></a>[pg 442]</span></div>
<p>"We are not free agents in this
matter," he said. "We must regulate
our proceedings by the proceedings of
our Allies."</p>
<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote of Credit for
225 million and authority to raise another
million men for Army agreed to
without dissent.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Lords and Commons
united in paying tribute to the life,
lamenting the death, of Lord <span class='smcap'>Roberts&mdash;"Bobs,"</span>
beloved of the Army, revered
in India, mourned throughout
the wide range of Empire. Even in
Germany, where hatred of all that is
English has become a monomania, exception
is made in his favour. "There
are moments," writes a sportsman in
the German Press, "when the
warrior salutes the enemy with
his sword instead of striking with
it. Such a moment came with the
death of Lord Roberts."</p>
<p>Speeches in both Houses worthy
of the occasion. Brief, simple,
genuine in emotion, they were well
attuned to the theme. One of the
happiest things said was uttered
by <span class='smcap'>Bonar Law</span>: "In his simplicity,
in his modesty, in his high-minded
uprightness, and in his stern detestation
of everything mean and
base, Lord <span class='smcap'>Roberts</span> was in real
life all, and more than all, that
<i>Colonel Newcome</i> was in fiction."</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Premier</span> proposed that on Monday
House shall authorise erection
of monument at the public charge
to the memory of the Great Soldier.
When motion formally put from
Chair heads were bared in farewell
salute of the warrior taking his rest.</p>
<p>Not the least touching note of
eloquence was supplied during proceedings
in House of Lords. It was
the empty seat at the corner of the
Front Cross Bench where on rare occasions
stood the lithe erect figure, in
stature not quite so high as <span class='smcap'>Napoleon</span>,
modestly offering words of counsel.</p>
<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Chancellor of
Exchequer</span>, presenting himself to
favourable consideration of crowded
House in homely character of coalheaver
filling bunkers of a battleship,
introduced second Budget of the year.
Upon consideration House comes to
conclusion that one is quite enough,
thank you. Proposals in Supplementary
Budget are what <i>Dominic Sampson</i>
might, with more than customary
appropriateness and emphasis, describe
as "Prodigious!" Faced by deficiency
of something over three-hundred-and-thirty-nine-and-a-half
millions,
<span class='smcap'>Chancellor</span> launches War Loan of
two hundred and thirty millions and
levies additional fifteen-and-a-half
millions in taxation.</p>
<p><i>Items:</i> Income Tax doubled; threepence
a pound added to tea; a halfpenny
clapped on price of every modest half-pint
of beer consumed.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Monotony of truce in
respect of Party politics varied by
wholesome heartening game. It consists
of hunting down the German spies
and chivying the <span class='smcap'>Home Secretary</span>.
Played in both Houses to-night. In
the Lords <span class='smcap'>Halsbury</span> attempted to
make Lord <span class='smcap'>Chancellor's</span> flesh creep
by disclosure of existence of "ingenious
system of correspondence" carried on
between alien spies and their paymaster
in Berlin. <span class='smcap'>Haldane</span> replied that the
matter had been closely investigated;
turned out there was "nothing in it."
<span class='smcap'>Crawford</span> fared no better. Imperturbable
<span class='smcap'>Lord Chancellor</span> assured House
that the military and civil authorities
in Scotland were cognisant of rumours
reported by noble Lord. Every
case that seemed to warrant investigation
had been looked into. Was found
that many were based on hearsay.
Impossible to find evidence to establish
charges made.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Chancellor of the Exchequer "in homely character of coalheaver filling bunkers of a battleship."</p>
</div>
<p>Nevertheless, <span class='smcap'>Londonderry</span>, having
dispassionately thought the matter over,
came to conclusion that conduct of <span class='smcap'>Home
Secretary</span> was "contemptible."</p>
<p>This opinion, phrased in differing
form, shared on Opposition Benches in
Commons. <span class='smcap'>Premier</span> explained that
business of dealing with aliens is not
concentrated in Home Office; is shared
with the War Office and the Admiralty.
Of late, on suggestion of Committee
of Imperial Defence, there has been
established at War Office an Intelligence
Department in correspondence
with the Admiralty and assured of
assistance of the Home Office wherever
necessary.</p>
<p>That all very well. Hon. Members
and noble Lords in Opposition not to
be disturbed in their honest conviction
that <span class='smcap'>McKenna</span> is at the bottom of the
bad business.</p>
<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;On suggestion of
<span class='smcap'>Bonar Law</span> and on motion of <span class='smcap'>Premier</span>
Select Committee appointed to consider
scheme of pensions and grants for men
wounded in the war, and for the widows
and orphans of those who have lost
their lives.</p>
<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Like <span class='smcap'>Marlbrook, Wedgwood
Benn</span> <i>s'en va-t-en guerre</i>. Has
sallied out with a troop of Middlesex
Hussars to "join our army in
Flanders," where, according to contemporary
testimony, once upon a
time it "swore terribly." His
Parliamentary services, supplemented
by the Chairmanship of
Committee controlling disposition
of National Relief Fund, might
seem sufficient to keep him at
home. But valour, like murder,
will out. So, as old <i>John Willett</i>,
landlord of the Maypole Inn, Chigwell,
used to say when asked of the
whereabouts of his son, "he has
gone to the Salwanners, where the
war is," carrying with him the
good wishes of all sections of House
and an exceptionally full knowledge
of the intricacies of the
Insurance Act.</p>
<p>Many gaps on Benches on both
sides. <span class='smcap'>Sark</span> tells me there are
seven-score Members on active
service at the Front. One of the
first to go was <span class='smcap'>Seely</span>, at brief
interval stepping from position of
Head of British Army to that of a
unit in its ranks.</p>
<p>News of him came the other day
from Private <span class='smcap'>James White</span>, of the
Inniskilling Fusiliers, now in hospital
at Belfast. Wounded by fragments of
a shell, <span class='smcap'>White</span> lay for an hour where
he fell. Then he felt a friendly hand
on his shoulder and a cheery voice
asked how he was getting on.</p>
<p>It was Colonel <span class='smcap'>Seely</span> bending over
him, regardless of heavy shell fire
directed on the spot by German batteries.
He gave the wounded Fusilier
a cigarette, helped him to get up and
assisted him to his motor-car, in which he
had all day been engaged in conveying
wounded to French hospital in the rear.</p>
<p>"He is the bravest man I ever met,"
said Private <span class='smcap'>James White</span>. "He was
as cool as the morning under fire,
cheering us all up with smiles and
little jokes."</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>This is the tale of the Blankshires bold, the famous charge they made;</p>
<p>This is the tale of the deeds they did whose glory never will fade;</p>
<p>They only numbered <i>X</i> hundred men and the German were thousands (<i>Y</i>),</p>
<p>Yet on the battlefield of <i>Z</i> they made the foeman fly.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Calm and cool on the field they stood (near a town&mdash;I can't say where);</p>

<h2>OUR NATIONAL GUESTS.</h2>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>The truth is that the Belgians in
Crashie Howe are enjoying a <i>succ&egrave;s fou</i>.
There is the enterprising Marie, who
thinks nothing of going off on her
own, on the strength of an English
vocabulary only a fortnight old, overwhelming
the stationmaster and boarding
an ambulance train full of wounded
Belgians at the local station to ask for
news of her brothers. (We were all
delighted when an adventurous letter
miraculously arrived from the Pas
de Calais on Saturday and reported
that both brothers were well and
unwounded.) There is Victor, who,
although only thirteen, is already a
<i>pupille d'arm&eacute;e</i> and has a uniform quite
as good as any fighting man. I can
tell you he has put our Boy Scouts in
the shade. But Victor is afraid the
war will be over before he is old enough
to get at it.</p>
<p>Then, again, there is the small
Juliette, who is dark, with a comfortable
little face constructed almost entirely of
dimples, and, at the age of eight, has
been discovered knitting stockings at
a prodigious pace while she looked
the other way. I am afraid Juliette
is being held up as an example to
other children of the neighbourhood,
but I think her great popularity may
well survive even that. And there is
Louis, who is a marvel at making bird-cages,
and Rosalie, whose pride is in
the shine of her pots and pans. They
are all doing well.</p>
<p>Rosalie, it is true, has had a fearful
bout of toothache, so bad that she had
to retire to bed for a day. When
Dr. Anderson, whose French is very
good, had successfully diagnosed the
trouble and told her that the only cure
was to have the tooth out, she plaintively
replied that she had thought of
that herself, but, alas, it was impossible,
for "it was too firmly implanted."
For my part I sympathised with
Rosalie&mdash;I have often felt like that.</p>
<p>The grandmother rather likes to sit
apart, beaming, far from the general
throng, and it was for that reason that
I selected her at the very outset to
practise on in private. I tried her
more than once in my sadly broken
French; I even went further and tried
her in rapidly-improvised Flemish.
Whenever I felt I was at my best I
used to go and have a turn at her, and,
although she smiled at me like anything
and was awfully pleased, I never
elicited the slightest response. Now I
know that she is almost stone deaf
and hasn't heard a word I have said.
As I came sadly away after this discovery
there occurred to my mind the
story of him who undertook to train
a savage in the arts of civilization,
only to learn, after some years of disappointing,
unrequited toil, that his
victim was not only a savage but also
a lunatic. I don't mean that to be
disrespectful to <i>Grandm&egrave;re</i>&mdash;it is only
a parallel instance of good work thrown
away.</p>
<p>We are learning a good deal that is
new about the art of knitting. One
thing is that the Flemish knitter
cannot get on at all comfortably unless
the needles are long enough to
tuck under her arms. I may safely
say that I never dreamt of that. At
first they fumbled about unhappily
with our miserable little needles, but
the ship's carpenter&mdash;who makes the
bird-cages&mdash;has found quite an ingenious
way out. He has mounted
all the needles at the end of a sort of
stilt or leg of cane (like a bayonet), and
since this innovation they are working
at a speed which, even in these days
of universal knitting, would be pretty
hard to beat.</p>
<p>The children are really getting on
famously at school. A very touching
little romance was enacted there one
day. Eug&egrave;ne and Pierre, belonging to
different families, arrived in our midst
on different days and did not chance
to meet each other at first. At school
they happened to be put, away from
their compatriots, in the same room.
Eug&egrave;ne is eight and Pierre seven. It
was, you may well guess, pretty lonely
work for a small Belgian in a roomful
of Scotch boys, but both bore up
bravely. The subject, as I understand,
was simple addition (which knows no
frontiers and looks the same in any
language), and there is no whispering
or secret conversation in our school, I
can tell you. There they sat side by
side for two hours, each contemplating
the other as an alien, each smothering
pent-up feelings of home-sickness. And
then suddenly, at a single Flemish word
from the schoolmaster, the moment of
revelation came; it dawned on both of
them at once that they were not alone,
and, rising to their feet, they embraced
with tears of joy.</p>
<p>"Broeder!" cried Eug&egrave;ne.</p>
<p>"Broeder!" echoed Pierre.</p>
<p>That was nearly a week ago. By
now Pierre is beginning to treat Eug&egrave;ne
in a slightly off-hand manner. He has
hardly time for him. He has so many
Scotch friends.</p>

<h3>THE IMMORTAL LEGEND.</h3>
<p>In the House of Commons on November
18, Mr. <span class='smcap'>King</span> asked the <span class='smcap'>Under-Secretary
for War</span> whether he could
state, without injury to the military
interests of the Allies, whether any
Russian troops had been conveyed
through Great Britain to the Western
area of the European War.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Tennant's</span> reply:&mdash;"I am uncertain
whether it will gratify or displease
my hon. friend to know that no Russian
troops have been conveyed through
Great Britain to the Western area of
the European War."</p>
<p>The firm and faithful believers in this
beautiful tale are not to be put off so
easily as that, and there are so many
thousands of faces to be saved, and such
numbers of ear- (if not eye-) witnesses
of the undying exploit, that we really
must see if there is not after all some
loophole in the official pronouncement.
Let us pause for further scrutiny and
meditations.</p>
<p>Why, of course, here it is. The
<span class='smcap'>Under-Secretary</span> merely states his
imperfect knowledge of the bias of Mr.
<span class='smcap'>King</span>. He does not know whether his
questioner is one of the ardent souls
who are ready to pass along and adorn
the latest legend from the Clubs, or a
cold-blooded sceptic fit only to be a
Censor.</p>
<p>No, we are not to be done out of our
Russians by any mere <span class='smcap'>Under-Secretary
for War</span>; certainly not one who
is capable of such prevarication. And
anyhow, why should the Germans do
all the story-telling?</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE WILD AND WOOLLY WEST END.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<span class='smcap'>A Protest.</span>&mdash;Is there any reason why the
War should be made an excuse for the
abandonment of the niceties of life? Dining
at a West-End restaurant nowadays one might
well imagine oneself in America, from the
variety and incongruity of the dress of the
male patrons."&mdash;<i>Advt. in "The Times."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We fear that the protest is only too
well justified. Indeed, much more
might be revealed were it not for the
heavy hand of the C&mdash;&mdash;r. Our special
representative reports:&mdash;</p>
<p>To the O.C., <i>Punch</i> Battalion,
Bouverie Brigade, Fleet Division, E.C.,
of London Reserves.</p>
<p class='center'><i>A City on the river T&mdash;&mdash;s.<br />
Nov. the &mdash;teenth.</i></p>
<p>Carrying out your order No. <span class='smcap'>69a</span>,
I made a night <a name='TC_3'></a><ins title="Was 'reconnaisance'">reconnaissance</ins> in
force. I have the honour to report that
at dinner at a certain hotel two hundred
yards east by north of railway base
C&mdash;&mdash;g X, I counted only five boiled
shirts. Have reason to suspect that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page445' name='page445'></a>[pg 445]</span>
they were subsidised by the management,
and were worn by Stock Exchange
members thrown out of employment
by the War and endeavouring to
supplement their private incomes.</p>
<p>The rest of the male costumes were
mainly khaki. One man entered
dining-room with Buffalo Bill hat
decorated with maple-leaf and A.M.S.
(Athabasca Mounted Scalpers), which
he deposited on chair next to him.
The only nut present endeavoured to
remove this object. The A.M.S. man
touched his hip-pocket significantly,
and said: "The drinks are on you."</p>
<p>At the table next to him was a group
of South American magnates in tweed
suits decorated with large buttons reading:
"<i>No me habla de la guerra!</i>" If
the man from Athabasca should start
conversation with them about the war,
it seemed probable that gun-fighting
would ensue. I therefore enfiladed the
position and took cover. However, the
sergeant-waiter tactfully shifted a palm
into screening position between the two
tables, and thus averted the spreading
of the War to Latin America.</p>
<p>Similar state of affairs existed in
stalls of certain theatre within outpost
distance of P&mdash;&mdash;y C&mdash;&mdash;s. Ladies
were openly knitting socks and intimate
woollen garments between the Acts.
Management seemed powerless to restore
the conventions of peace-time.</p>
<p>At the C&mdash;&mdash;n Tavern the bar-tender
had pasted notice on mirror behind him:
"This Saloon closes at ten sharp.
Gents are kindly requested not to start
nothing here." The announcement
seemed to have been effective, for very
few bullet-marks were to be noted.</p>
<p>By midnight, L&mdash;&mdash;r S&mdash;&mdash;e and
R&mdash;&mdash;t S&mdash;&mdash;t were comparatively
clear of dagos. This was due to efforts
of street-cleaning corps (3rd County of
L&mdash;&mdash;n Light Hose).</p>

<h3>THE NEW ANÆSTHETIC.</h3>
<p class='center'><span class='smcap'>Remarkable Discovery.<br />
Medical Science Superseded.</span></p>
<p>A correspondent in whose accuracy
we place the highest trust informs us
of very remarkable results which have
been achieved by the adoption of a new
means of alleviating pain and suffering
invented by a lady in London. This
lady being suddenly taken with lumbago
was in great agony until she remembered
our soldiers at the front, and
thought how much worse was a wound,
and instantly, our correspondent is
informed, some of her own distress left
her. The case has been investigated by
several eminent inquirers and they are
satisfied with her story.</p>
<p>Meanwhile evidence of a similar
nature comes from other parts of the
country, in every case recording a
sense of personal well-being, though
only comparative, and an increased
disinclination to complain, upon the
realisation of what it must be to be a
soldier just now&mdash;whether up to his
knees in a flooded trench, or sleeping
on the wet ground, or lying in agony
waiting to be picked up and taken to a
hospital, or being taken to a hospital
over jolting roads, or going without
meals, or having to boil tea over a
candle-flame, or awakening from the
operation and finding himself maimed
for life.</p>
<p>Nor is the lenitive of this little effort
of imagination confined to bodily ills;
for a well-authenticated case reaches
us of a notoriously mean man of wealth
who was not heard to utter a single
word of grumbling over the new war
taxes after realising what the soldier's
burden was too. Hence <i>Mr. Punch</i> is
only too happy to give publicity to the
discovery.</p>

<h2>THE LAST BOTTLE.</h2>
<p>I had been drilling all the morning,
and had spent the whole of the afternoon
squirming face downwards on the
moist turf of Richmond Park in an
endeavour to advance, as commanded,
in extended order. In the morning&mdash;that
is during compressed drill&mdash;I had
been twice wounded. Owing to lack
of education a famous novelist had
confused his left hand with his right,
with the result that when we were right-turned
he had dealt me a terrific blow
on the ear with the barrel
of his rifle. It soon
ceased to be an ear, and
became of the size and
consistency of a muffin.
My second casualty was
brought about by a well-known
orchestral conductor,
who however
confidently he could pilot
his players through the
most complicated Symphonic
Poem was invariably
out of his depth
whenever, the ranks being
turned about, he was
required to form fours.
His man&oelig;uvre that
morning had been a wild
and undisciplined fugue,
culminating in an unconventional
<i>stretto</i> upon an
exceedingly dominant
pedal-point, that is to
say, his heel on my toe.</p>
<p>Consequently when I
arrived home in the
evening, wet, soiled,
hungry and maimed, I
felt that I needed a
little artificial invigoration.
A bright idea occurred
to me as I was
waiting for the bath to
fill.</p>
<p>"Joan," I cried, "don't
you think I might open Johann to-night?"
Joan, who had been trying to
decide whether it would not be more
advisable to have my sweater dyed
a permanent shot-green and brown,
demurred.</p>
<p>"I thought your anti-German conscience
would not permit you to open
Johann until after the war's over," she
called back.</p>
<p>"My anti-German conscience has
been severely wounded," I replied. "It
hasn't sufficient strength to hold out
much longer. In a few seconds it will
surrender unconditionally."</p>
<p>"Be brave," urged Joan. "Just
think how proud you will be in days to
come when you look back to this
evening and realise how, in the face of
the most terrible temptations, you
triumphed!"</p>
<p>"That's all very fine," I remarked,
"but to-night I feel I need Johann
medicinally. If I don't have him, there
may be <i>no</i> days to come. Do be
reasonable. Do you suppose that if
the <span class='smcap'>Kaiser</span>, for instance, were bitten
by a mad dog&mdash;a real one, I mean&mdash;that
his anti-Ally conscience would forbid
his adoption of the Pasteur treatment?"</p>
<p>"Then if you really feel the need
of a special refresher," said Joan, "at
least let me send Ph&oelig;be out for a
bottle of some friendly or neutral
substitute."</p>
<p>A vivid recollection of Ph&oelig;be's being
despatched once before in an emergency
for mustard and returning with custard
flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>"She's much too unreliable," I cried.
"She'd get bay rum, or something
equally futile. It must be Johann or
nothing."</p>
<p>"Then," said Joan, "let us say
nothing"&mdash;an ambiguity of which I
determined to take full advantage.</p>
<p>Johann, I must now explain, was the
sole survivor of six small bottles of the
genuine Rhine brand which Joan's
uncle (who is in the trade) had given
her last Christmas. Number Five had
been opened on the evening of August
Bank Holiday after a strenuous day on
the tennis courts. Later, when hostilities
had started all round I had taken
a terrible oath that nothing of German
or Austrian origin should be used in our
household until Peace broke out. This
necessitated the sacrifice of at least four
inches of breakfast sausage and the
better part of a box of Carlsbad plums.
Johann, being intact, was merely interned.
But at that time I had not
anticipated that some three months
later I should be exhausted by long
and tiring drills and man&oelig;uvres.</p>
<p>However, on this night
my body cried aloud for
Johann's refreshing contents.
I did not care
two pins that he had
been manufactured on
the banks of the Rhine,
or that he was the product
of alien and hostile
hands. After all, it
wasn't Johann's fault;
and besides, surely he
had been long enough
in England to become
naturalised. At any rate
it was both prejudiced
and illogical to assume
that Johann was my
enemy solely because he
happened to be born in
Germany.</p>
<p>The bath took some
time to fill. The taps, I
think, wanted sweeping.
But during the time that
elapsed I made up my
mind. Johann should be
opened. I slipped on
my dressing-gown and
went in search of him.
When I had secured him
I met Joan on the landing;
she was just going
down to dinner.</p>
<p>"Haven't you had
your bath yet?" she
asked. "Hurry up and&mdash;oh! you've
got Johann!"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said. "I have decided
that there is no evidence to prove that
he is not a naturalised British bottle.
I am going to open him."</p>
<p>"You renegade!" Joan cried. "If
you dare so much as to loosen his cork
I'll&mdash;I'll give you an Iron Cross."</p>
<p>"I'm desperate," I answered. "I
would still open Johann even if you
threatened me with the Iron Cross of
both the first and the second class."</p>
<p>"Coward!" said Joan. "Still, if
you're really determined to open him,
remember half belongs to me."</p>
<p>A moment later I had poured half
the contents of Johann&mdash;his full name
is Johann Maria Farina&mdash;into my bath.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p class='center'>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>
<p>In <i>The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman</i> (<span class='smcap'>Macmillan</span>) that
impenitent pamphleteer, <span class='smcap'>H. G. Wells</span>, returns yet again to
the intriguing subject of marriage, and in a vein something
nearer orthodoxy. Not, certainly, that worthy stubborn
orthodoxy of accepted unquestioned doctrine, or that sleeker
variety of middle-aged souls that were once young, now
too tired or bored to go on asking questions, but an orthodoxy
rather that is honest enough to revise on the
evidence earlier judgments as too cocksure and hasty. <i>Sir
Isaac Harman</i> was a tea-shop magnate, and a very pestilent
and primitive cad who caught his wife young and poor and
battered her into reluctant surrender by a stormy wooing,
whose very sincerity and abandonment were but a frantic
expression of his dominating egotism and acquisitiveness.
Wooing and winning, thinks this simple ignoble knight, is
a thing done once and for all. Remains merely obedience
in very plain and absolute terms on the part of lady to
lord, obedience which, in the last resort, can be exacted by
withholding supplies&mdash;not so uncommon a form of blackmail
as it suits the dominant sex to imagine. <i>Lady
Harman's</i> emancipation does not take the conventionally
unconventional form, for some deeper reason, I think, than
that her sententious friend and would-be lover, <i>George
Brumley</i>, could not altogether escape her gentle contempt;
indeed, she recognises <i>Sir Isaac's</i> claims upon her for
duty and gratitude in a way which modern high-spirited
priestesses of progress would scarcely approve. She fights
merely for a limit to the proprietorship, for the right to a
separate individuality, the right to be useful in a wider
sphere (a phrase that stands for so much that is good and
less good). Mr. <span class='smcap'>Wells</span> has realised this gracious, shy and
beautiful personality with a fine skill. It is no mean feat.
He might so easily have made a dear mild ghost. And
oh! if ladies of influence who regiment their inferiors in
orderly philanthropic schemes had some of the wisdom and
tolerance of <i>Lady Harman</i> in her dealings with the tea-shop
girls. You see one instinctively pays Mr. <span class='smcap'>Wells</span> the
serious compliment of assuming that he has something
material to say about the things which matter.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>As a demonstration of the irony of history, I can hardly
imagine a better subject for romance at the present
moment than the fortunes of <span class='smcap'>William of Orange</span>, and
if Miss <span class='smcap'>Marjorie Bowen's</span> <i>Prince and Heretic</i> (<span class='smcap'>Methuen</span>)
shows some traces of having been rather hastily finished
it is easy to pardon this defect. The alchemist's assistant,
part seer and part quack, whom she introduces into the
earlier part of the story foretells the violent deaths of the
young princes of the house of Nassau and the ravaging
and looting of the Netherlands by <span class='smcap'>Alva</span>, Defender of the
Catholic Faith and servant of the House of Hapsburg;
but he cannot conjure up out of his crystal the sight of a
Catholic Belgium suffering these things, three hundred and
fifty years later, at the hands of a Lutheran King allied with
a Hapsburg and fighting for the sake of no cause but his
own vanity. Most of the action takes place in Brussels&mdash;a
Brussels placarded with squibs against <span class='smcap'>Cardinal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page448' name='page448'></a>[pg 448]</span>
Granville</span>; and the final retreat of <span class='smcap'>William</span>, ruined in
everything except his spirit, to join the army of the <span class='smcap'>Prince
de Cond&eacute;</span>, has a pathetic significance to-day that not
many historical romances can claim. Miss <span class='smcap'>Marjorie
Bowen</span> has a remarkable gift for the presentation of a
number of lifelike portraits against a vivid and gorgeous
background, and the successive pictures of the Dutch and
Flemish Schools which she creates in <i>Prince and Heretic</i>,
make it, if not quite so successful as <i>I Will Maintain</i>, at
least a book which no lover of the Lowlands can afford
to miss.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p><i>Our Sentimental Garden</i> (<span class='smcap'>Heinemann</span>) is one of the very
pleasantest garden-books I have encountered. One reason
for this is that it is about such a lot of other things besides
gardens. Volumes that
are exclusively devoted
to what I might call
horticultural hortation
are apt to become oppressive.
But <span class='smcap'>Agnes</span> and
<span class='smcap'>Egerton Castle</span> are
persons far too sympathetic
not to avoid this
danger. Instead of lecturing,
they talk with an
engaging discursiveness
that lures you from page
to page, as it might from
bed to border, were you
an actual visitor in the
exquisite Surrey garden
that is their ostensible
subject. One thing with
them leads to another.
"Lilacs," they say.
"Ah, lilacs&mdash;" and immediately
one of them is
started upon a whole
series of rambling, <span class='smcap'>Du
Maurierish</span> recollections
of school-days in
Second Empire Paris.
Kittens and Pekinese
puppies, village types,
politics (just a little) and
Roman villas&mdash;all these
are the themes of their
happy talk. "The Garden
Garrulous" they might have called the book; and I for
one have found it infinitely charming. Not that shrewd
hints upon the choice of roses, the marshalling of bulbs,
and other such aspects of the theme proper are wanting.
Moreover, what they tell of garden triumphs is at once
realised for you by a prodigality of drawings scattered
among the text, some glowing in a full page of colour, others
in line alone, from the pencil and brush of Mr. <span class='smcap'>Charles
Robinson</span>. Altogether a very gentle book, of which one
may echo the hope expressed by the writers in their graceful
preface that "some unquiet heart, labouring under the
strain of long-drawn suspense," may find in it "a passing
relaxation, a forgotten smile."</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Ernest students of military history should be grateful to
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Edward Foord</span> for the patient labour and perseverance
he has spent on the compilation of <i>Napoleon's Russian
Campaign of 1812</i> (<span class='smcap'>Hutchinson</span>). The book appears at a
most opportune date, for most of us nowadays are military
critics, and here we can, if we like, compare the Russian
methods of 1812 with those of 1914. On the other hand,
in these strenuous days we may not have the time, even if
we have the inclination, to devote ourselves to campaigns
a hundred years old. For my own part, while frankly
admitting the value of this book, I confess that I had sometimes
to skip in an endeavour to avoid being bewildered by
names and numbers. Using this desultory mode of progression
I was still abundantly informed and profoundly
interested. Mr. <span class='smcap'>Foord</span> is out to give facts, however
tedious, and I agree with him that it is the business of an
historian to be accurate before he is entertaining. Yet I
could have wished that he had been less parsimonious with
his human appeals, for whenever he unbends he can be at
once interesting and informing. The struggles of <span class='smcap'>Barclay
de Tolly</span> against jealousy and intrigues are vividly told,
and nothing could be
more graceful than the
tribute Mr. <span class='smcap'>Foord</span> pays
to the memory of that
great soldier, General
<span class='smcap'>Ebl&eacute;</span>. It is impossible
to read the history of
this disastrous campaign
without being impressed
by the terrible penalties
of overweening arrogance
and ambition, and without
realising the flaming
spirit of patriotism that
has glorified, and will
always glorify, the Russians
in time of national
peril.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>In <i>A Morning In My
Library</i> ("<span class='smcap'>Times" Book
Club</span>), Mr. <span class='smcap'>Stephen
Coleridge</span> has put together
an anthology of
English prose which has
some high advantages to
recommend it to popular
favour even in what the
compiler calls "these
tumultuous times." It
is a small book and fits
easily into a coat pocket;
it is well and clearly
printed, and, best of
all, the selection is admirably made and does credit to
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Coleridge's</span> taste. Every extract bears the stamp
of inspiration, a quality difficult to define but unmistakable.
<span class='smcap'>Raleigh's</span> invocation to Death; <span class='smcap'>Johnson's</span>
preface to the Dictionary; <span class='smcap'>Napier's</span> description of the
battle of Albuera; <span class='smcap'>Richard Shiel's</span> appeal on behalf of
his fellow-countrymen, and <span class='smcap'>Abraham Lincoln's</span> immortal
speech at Gettysburg&mdash;all these are to be found, and many
more; and all go to show the might, majesty, dominion
and power of that great language which it is our privilege
to speak. I think we shall value that privilege a little
more highly and shall endeavour to place a more careful
restraint on our tongues and our pens after we have dipped
through Mr. <span class='smcap'>Coleridge's</span> little book. He is a judicious
guide, and such explanations as he adds are always short
and never tiresome. Yet it must in fairness be added that
<span class='smcap'>King Charles's</span> head, in the shape of an anti-vivisection
footnote, has once, but only once, crept into the "memorial."
However the fault is such a little one that those who love
noble English prose will easily forgive it.</p>
